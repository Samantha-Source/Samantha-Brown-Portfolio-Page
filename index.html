      <p>
        I am currently a student in Thinkful's Software Engineering Prep Course and am on my way to becoming a sofware developer! 
      </p>
       <p>
         In the next year I plan to accomplish the following:
      </p>
        <!-- ordered list -->
        <ol>
          <li> Graduating from Thinkful</li>
          <li> Getting a career I Love!</li>
          <li> Saving money to move someplace warmer</li>
        </ol>
      <p>
        Currently I reside in New Jersey, just outside of New York City, with my fiance and 2 dogs.

        About Me
      </h2>
      <p>
        I was previously an EMT but have decided to change careers and revist an old passion of mine - coding!  I especially love that software engineering allows you to be creative and build and design anything you can dream of!  I especially enjoy the people that I have already met on my engineering journey and love how many different insights people have on ways to solve the same problem - the things you can learn from other people is endless!
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of software development I have a passion for cooking, trying new food, art, reading, and nature.
