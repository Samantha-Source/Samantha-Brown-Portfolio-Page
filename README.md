# Portfolio-Page
 Samantha Brown's Portfolio Page

This is the initial portfolio page being created as part of Thinkful's prep course for engineering.  It will be updated frequently as I gain new skills and progress as a developer.

Created by Samantha M. Brown - 2022

Acknowledgements go to:
- Thinkful for starting me on my journey and teaching me the skills needed to build this page.
- My pups Zara and Midnight for reminding me to take play breaks.
- My wonderful Fiance Eldad for his unwavering support and listening to me endlessly ramble on about the things I'm learning of which he understands none.
