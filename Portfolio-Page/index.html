        About Me
      </h2>
      <p>
        I was previously an EMT but have decided to change careers and revist an old passion of mine - coding!  I especially love that software engineering allows you to be creative and build and design anything you can dream of!  I especially enjoy the people that I have already met on my engineering journey and love how many different insights people have on ways to solve the same problem - the things you can learn from other people is endless!
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of software development I have a passion for cooking, trying new food, art, reading, and nature.
